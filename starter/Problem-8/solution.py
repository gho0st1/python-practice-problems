Problem-8: Guessing game

Write a function that takes a number 1 to 9 from the user input (use input function inside a function). 
Store a number in a variable (letâ€™s assume 6). 
- If the input value is less than the variable, print (your guess is almost there), 
- if the input value is greater than the variable, print - your guess is higher, 
- if the input value and variable are equals, print - Your Guess Is Correct!
